#+title: How-To Nix (yet another guide to development environments)
#+description: Nix is like Python's venv, but for any language or tool. Nix is a build system. Nix is also difficult, but my aim is to lower the barrier of entry.

You've probably heard of [[https://nixos.org/][=Nix=]]. If you haven't, well... The landing page explains
everything (just trust me ðŸ‘€), or maybe it confuses you even more.

#+begin_quote
Declarative builds and deployments. Nix is a tool that takes a unique approach to package management and system configuration.

eAsY rIgHt?! The same way the =monad is just a monoid in the category of
endofunctors= makes zero sense for me, Nix's description is bit obtuse. Once the
concepts start making sense, it ruins you in a good way. Let's build a tiny
program using Nix, and slowly understand why /reproducible development
environments/ are valuable.

* Installing Nix
The tooling is available on [[https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-linux][=Linux=]], [[https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-macos][=MacOS=]], [[https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-windows][=WSL2=]], and more. If you want to
immediately go /balls deep/ you can install [[https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso][=NixOS=]] on a useless laptop. The
first time I tried out Nix was on an Ubuntu VM, because I didn't want to screw
up my existing Linux installation.

We'll use =Nix Flakes= (more on that later), which is still considered
experimental, but in my opinion essential to ensure a reproducible development
environment. In order to enable the flakes ecosystem, you can temporarily enable
it when running the ~nix~ command.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' help
#+end_src

However, typing it out every time quickly becomes annoying, so you can append it
to nix's configuration file.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
#+end_src

And if you are using NixOS (nice!). You can add it to your configuration.

#+begin_src nix
nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
#+end_src

* Messing Around with Nix Packages
Let's say you are writing a blog post, and want to showcase a package ~hello~
without polluting your existing Linux installation. I do not have this package
installed, nor do I need it outside the scope of this article. Instead of
installing it, and then forgetting to clean it up, we can ask =Nix= to
temporarily make it available.

The ~nix shell~ command starts a new shell and brings packages from the
~nixpkgs~ flake into the shell environment.

#+begin_src sh :exports results :results output :wrap example
nix shell nixpkgs#hello nixpkgs#cowsay
hello | cowsay
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 _______________
< Hello, world! >
 ---------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
#+end_example

Once you ~exit~ the shell, there's no more ~hello~, and no more ~cowsay~. It's
as if these packages were never installed. In reality, they are still downloaded
and locally available on your system. If you were to create a shell with the
same packages Nix only has to create a /symbolic link/ to make them available for
use.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
# NOTE(Kevin): Notice how fast it executes
nix shell nixpkgs#hello nixpkgs#cowsay --command sh -c "hello | cowsay"
#+end_src

If you want to try out other packages, you can search the =Nix Package
Repository= using ~nix search nixpkgs name-of-package~ or via the [[https://search.nixos.org/packages][website]].
There's plenty of packages to try out: CLI tools, emulators, editors (yes
neovim), and even more obscure packages might be readily available. According to
[[https://repology.org/repositories/graphs][Repology]] the list of available packages looks huge, even compared to the =AUR=.

* An Actual Practical Guide to =Nix Flakes=
I don't know about you, but I'm getting tired of constantly typing ~hello~ and
~cowsay~ whenever I want an elevated shell with these packages. More
importantly, how do we ensure these packages behave exactly the same way on
different machines? There's a chance the channel version of the ~nixpkgs~ is
different than mine, which /can/ yield different results on different machines.

In order to properly pin down the exact version of ~nixpkgs~ we are going to
build a =Nix Flake=. Let's initialize our flake, and inspect what it created.
The =flake.nix= file looks somewhat familiar to a =package.json=, except ~nix~
is an actual programming language for configuring systems.

#+name: nix-flake-init
#+begin_src sh :results output :wrap src nix
mkdir -p first-flake
cd first-flake
nix flake init
cat ./flake.nix
#+end_src

The ~inputs~ specify the dependencies of the flake. In our case, we depend on
the =nixpkgs= repository under the =nixos= organization using the
=nixos-unstable= branch. The ~description~ can be whatever you feel like.

If you are unfamiliar with language, the ~outputs~ part can look confusing. In
Javascript, this would be somewhat equivalent to ~const outputs = ({ self,
nixpkgs }) => ({})~.

#+RESULTS: nix-flake-init
#+begin_src nix
{
  description = "A very basic flake";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {

    packages.x86_64-linux.hello = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.hello;

    packages.x86_64-linux.default = self.packages.x86_64-linux.hello;

  };
}
#+end_src

Let's change the ~description~, remove the two ~packages~ references, and make
sure the ~inputs~ depend on the more stable =nixos-23.11= branch.

The ~system~ variable depends on what processor architecture your system uses.
There's ways to support multiple systems, but that's an exercise for the reader.
The ~pkgs~ variable is how we get access to packages available for our processor
architecture.

Here's a list of possible options (you should change my ~aarch64-linux~ to a value that works for your architecture):
- Linux (Intel/AMD): ~x86_64-linux~
- Linux (ARM): ~aarch64-linux~
- MacOS (M1/2/3): ~aarch64-darwin~
- MacOS (Intel/AMD): ~x86_64-darwin~

#+begin_src nix :tangle ./second-flake/flake.nix :mkdirp yes
{
  description = "Hello World from Nix";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "aarch64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    # TODO(Kevin): Add reproducible shell environment
  };
}
#+end_src

Even though we chose a stable version for the ~nixpkgs~, it's still not clear
how =Nix Flakes= pins down the exact version. The ~nix flake lock~ command
generates a lock file, which snapshots the exact git hash the flake uses for the
packages. We have to track the =flake.nix= with ~git~, otherwise the flake
commands won't pick it up.

#+begin_src sh :results output :wrap src json :dir ./second-flake
git add flake.nix
nix flake lock
cat ./flake.lock
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src json
{
  "nodes": {
    "nixpkgs": {
      "locked": {
        "lastModified": 1713145326,
        "narHash": "sha256-m7+IWM6mkWOg22EC5kRUFCycXsXLSU7hWmHdmBfmC3s=",
        "owner": "nixos",
        "repo": "nixpkgs",
        "rev": "53a2c32bc66f5ae41a28d7a9a49d321172af621e",
        "type": "github"
      },
      "original": {
        "owner": "nixos",
        "ref": "nixos-23.11",
        "repo": "nixpkgs",
        "type": "github"
      }
    },
    "root": {
      "inputs": {
        "nixpkgs": "nixpkgs"
      }
    }
  },
  "root": "root",
  "version": 7
}
#+end_src

From this point forward, if two machines use the exact same =flake.lock=, the
packages and their dependencies will be exactly the same on both machines. But
what packages though? We haven't referenced any so far. _You are right!_
Remember the =TODO= from earlier?

The ~devShells.${system}.default~ is an attribute that's expected by the flake
when we wish to setup a shell. The ~pkgs.mkShell~ is a function which expects an
attribute set. In this attribute set we can define our packages, by referencing
them via the ~pkgs~ variable.

#+begin_src nix :tangle ./third-flake/flake.nix :mkdirp yes
{
  description = "Hello World from Nix";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "aarch64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      packages = [
        pkgs.hello
        pkgs.cowsay
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :exports none :results none :dir ./third-flake :mkdirp yes
git add flake.nix
nix flake lock
#+end_src

Now that we've added these packages, everyone who uses nix with flakes, can run
~nix develop~ to setup the shell, which provides the packages based on the
=flake.nix=. Remember that the =flake.lock= pins down these packages to the
exact same version, meaning that the packages and their dependencies will be
exactly the same on different machines.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
nix develop
hello | cowsay
#+end_src

It's also still possible to invoke the commands using a one-liner.
#+begin_src sh :results output :dir ./third-flake :mkdirp yes :wrap example
nix develop --command sh -c "hello | cowsay"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 _______________
< Hello, world! >
 ---------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
#+end_example

* Reproducible Development Environments for Any Language
If you are familiar with the =Node Version Manager= or =Python's Virtual
Environments=, you can draw some similarities. Except, you are able to setup the
development environment independently from the languages itself. Are you working
on a project which requires ~nodejs_18~ and ~python3~? Done. Do you want to
provide a default debugger when working on a ~C/C++~ project? Done. Do you want
setup an environment for =Github Actions=? Done!

If a =Javascript= project use nix already, anyone who clones the project should
be able to run ~nix develop~ and have a fully working development environment
available. For the sake of the article though, let's assume you want to
contribute to a fictional project which uses ~bun~. You throw out your computer,
because you didn't know there was yet another way to run Javascript...

Anyways, you add ~pkgs.bun~ to the list of packages inside the ~pkgs.mkShell~
set.

#+begin_src nix :tangle ./fourth-flake/flake.nix :mkdirp yes
{
  description = "Hello World from Nix";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "aarch64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      packages = [
        pkgs.hello
        pkgs.cowsay
        pkgs.bun
      ];
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :exports none :results none :dir ./fourth-flake :mkdirp yes
git add flake.nix
nix flake lock
#+end_src

Once we start the shell with ~nix develop~, we are able to run our complicated
app using ~bun~ (as recommended by the fictional project maintainers). Our
application at home:

#+begin_src c :mkdirp yes :tangle ./fourth-flake/hello.js :results none
console.log("Hello from Nix and Javascript!");
#+end_src

If you would like to work inside the development environment provided by nix, we
can again run ~nix develop~, and run our code. Remember, ~cowsay~ is still
available because we haven't removed it yet from the =flake.nix=. The flake pins
down ~bun~'s version, so you are running the exact same version as these
fictional project maintainers.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
nix develop
bun ./hello.js | cowsay
#+end_src

Or using the one-liner.
#+begin_src sh :results output :dir ./fourth-flake :mkdirp yes :wrap example
nix develop --command sh -c "bun ./hello.js | cowsay"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
 ________________________________
< Hello from Nix and Javascript! >

        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
#+end_example

* Building and Packaging Applications with Nix
Bundling an application for =Node.js= is slightly more involved, and is going to
be an exercise for the reader. We're going to write a small ~C~ program and ship
it with ~nix~. Don't worry, nothing fancy here.

#+begin_src c :mkdirp yes :tangle ./fifth-flake/src/hello.c :results none
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello from Nix and C!");
   return 0;
}
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :exports none :results none :dir ./fifth-flake :mkdirp yes
git add flake.nix src/hello.c
nix flake lock
#+end_src

Remember the packages we've removed after running ~nix flake init~? It's time to
bring them back, but tailor them to help us build the C program. The
~pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation~ is function with a set as it's argument. The
attributes ~pname~, ~version~ and ~src~ are required.

In ~buildPhase~ we tell nix how which compiler to use to build our program. The
~installPhase~ places the executable in a bin folder so nix knows where to find
it when you want to run the application. By default ~nix run~ looks inside the
=./result/bin/= folder for an executable with the name taken from ~pname~.

#+begin_src nix :tangle ./fifth-flake/flake.nix :mkdirp yes
{
  description = "Hello World from Nix";
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-23.11";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
    system = "aarch64-linux";
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
      packages = [
        pkgs.hello
        pkgs.cowsay
        pkgs.bun
      ];

      inputsFrom = [
        self.packages.${system}.myHello
      ];
    };

    packages.${system} = {
      myHello = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
        pname = "my-hello";
        version = "v0.0.1";
        src = ./src;

        # NOTE(Kevin): We don't have to go into ./src during the phase, because
        # it assumes the working directory to already include the files from src
        buildPhase = ''
          gcc hello.c -o my-hello
        '';

        installPhase = ''
          mkdir -p $out/bin
          cp my-hello $out/bin/
        '';

        buildInputs = [
        ];
      };
      default = self.packages.${system}.myHello;
    };
  };
}
#+end_src

Running ~nix build~ builds our application, the ~$out~ variable translates to
the =./result= folder. After building it, you can run the executable via
~./result/bin/my-hello~.

#+begin_src sh :results output :wrap example :dir ./fifth-flake :mkdirp yes
nix build
nix shell nixpkgs#tree -c tree result
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
result
â””â”€â”€ bin
    â””â”€â”€ my-hello

2 directories, 1 file
#+end_example

Or use ~nix run~, which is the equivalent of running ~nix build &&
./result/bin/my-hello~ without creating the =./result= folder inside the current
working directory.
#+begin_src sh :results output :wrap example :dir ./fifth-flake :mkdirp yes
nix run
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Hello from Nix and C!
#+end_example

The perceptive readers might be thinking: "Wait a darn minute! We are missing
~pkgs.gcc~, it's not part of the flake? Stop fooling us!

The ~buildInputs~ is the one responsible for defining all the build dependencies
of our package. Yet, we don't need it here because ~mkDerivation~ is a helper that
already bundles ~gcc~ by default. These potential dependencies are also exposed
to the reproducible development environment via ~inputsFrom~.

The packages from the reproducible development environment are purposely not
available during ~nix build~ and ~nix run~, in order to prevent accidentally
depending on packages that are only available on my system when I built them.

Of course running ~nix develop~ in combination with ~nix run~ is not a problem.

#+begin_src sh :exports results :results output :wrap example
nix develop -c sh -c "nix run | cowsay"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

                ||     ||
#+end_example

* Conclusion
There's so much to learn about the =Nix= ecosystem, as we've barely touched the
surface. I'm personally still learning a lot about it, even while writing this
article. The main draw for me to use Nix is being able to jump in and out of a
project, and have the whole development environment setup using ~nix develop~.

If you wish to see a more /production/ level =flake.nix=, you can check out my
[[https://github.com/venikx/venikx.com/blob/main/flake.nix][personal website]], [[https://github.com/venikx/uniorg/blob/master/flake.nix][uniorg]] (a project I contribute to) or my [[https://github.com/venikx/dotfiles][dotfiles]] (nix
configuration for my laptop, desktop, and macbook).

*** Fun Fact
Nix sounds like "nothing" for a Belgian, so when I'm talking in Dutch about nix,
it often get confusing. =I'm trying to understand nothing.=
