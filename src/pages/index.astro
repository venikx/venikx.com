    I write about web technologies, and graphics programming. My goal with
    writing is to <em>educate myself</em>, while keeping the learning as
    entertaining.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-2xl">Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I've been delivering projects for multiple clients, in a wide variety of
    technologies, but the stack I'm most comfortable with is Typescript,
    Next.js, Node.js and PostreSQL (with Prisma).

    Purely for shits and giggles, I'm exploring the creative possibilities of
    coding using WebGL and OpenGL (C/C++). <em>But!</em> It's not easy! There's
    a lot of math and computer science-y concepts and I never seem to <em
      >get'em</em
    >. I read that writing helps with understand, so... <em>Welcome! Hi!</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, people seem to love Rust and Golang. I need to hop on deez before it's
    too late!
